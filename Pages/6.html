                Name - Yamcha’s Death Pose<br><br>
                Origin - Dragon Ball Z (Chapter 21)<br><br>
                Date - March 1989<br><br>
                By - Akira Toriyama<br><br>
                Yamcha thought he had defeated his foe Saibaiman, but he was caught off guard by its self-destruction. His pose after dying to a mediocre enemy became the iconic pose of weakness. This pose got refrenced as a gag in other anime and manga.
